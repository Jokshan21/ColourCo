    const rawText = `ColourCo WeatherPro is a tough, durable exterior coating with Ultraflex‚Ñ¢ that provides lasting elasticity against hairline cracks and ensures Ultimate weather resistance.

‚Ä¢ Weatherpro Fine Textured offers a matt finish that is available in 30 colours (Colour swatch references are as accurate as modern printing will allow.)
‚Ä¢ Weatherpro is available in 5 Liters, 10 Liters and 20 Liters (lift with care for pack sizes 10 Liters and over)
‚Ä¢ Weatherpro comes with a Guarantee 15 years (register your guarantee on www.colourco.co.za within 30 days of purchase)
‚Ä¢ This coating is ideal for surfaces like cement plaster, concrete, fibre cement, and similar materials, provided surface preparation is done correctly.
‚Ä¢ Application can be done using a brush or roller and takes 60 minutes to dry (Spray only suitable for Weatherpro UltraSmooth)
‚Ä¢ The coverage is 7‚Äì9 meters squared per litre per coat, and 2 coats are recommended which must be done 4 hours apart
‚Ä¢ To apply this product, begin by stirring thoroughly with a flat paddle until the mixture is completely uniform. Make sure the surface temperature is between 10 and 35 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity ranges from 10 to 85 percent or at least 2 degrees above dew point.
‚Ä¢ The coating is ready to use with a brush or roller. Spray application isn‚Äôt recommended because it contains fine marble aggregate.
‚Ä¢ When using a roller, be careful not to overspread. Apply two coats with a minimum of four hours between them. Follow the recommended spreading rate closely‚Äîtoo thick or too thin can cause visible inconsistencies. Use V-shaped strokes, combining horizontal, diagonal, and vertical movements. Maintain a wet edge during application, and for best results, use a lamb‚Äôs wool roller.
‚Ä¢ If brushing, apply using upward strokes, laying on and finishing carefully to avoid uneven textures.
‚Ä¢ Do not thin the product‚Äîthinning will reduce opacity and its ability to bridge cracks.
‚Ä¢ Touch dry can be done in about 60 minutes and second coats can be applied after four hours at 23 degrees Celsius. Drying may take longer in colder or wetter conditions.
‚Ä¢ After use, clean off as much of the product as possible, then wash the equipment with clean water.
‚Ä¢ Ensure good ventilation during application and drying.
‚Ä¢ For detailed safety information click on Material Safety Data Sheet or Technical data sheet.
‚Ä¢ Keep out of reach of children.
